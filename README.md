# Christmas-Lights-Arduino-Project
December 2021
Created by: Andrew Ha

The purpose of this project is to further my knowledge in using the ESP8266 Wifi Module and the idea of a direct link between 2 of these modules, whilst engineering a system which is fitting to the season (Christmas). This project was done with a finite state machine type of code to simulate the system being multithreaded, such that it may react to inputs into the system at a synchronous timeframe.

For this project, I had used:
  2X NodeMCU V3 ESP8266 Wifi Modules
  2X 8 channel relays
  3X patterned outdoors lights
  1X stringed LED lights
  as well as Various electronic switches, LEDs, and current limiting resistors
