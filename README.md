# Christmas-Lights-Arduino-Project
December 2021
Created by: Andrew Ha

The purpose of this project is to further my knowledge in using the ESP8266 Wifi Module and the idea of a direct link between 2 of these modules, whilst engineering a system which is fitting to the season (Christmas). This project was done with a finite state machine type of code to allow the system to multitask, such that it may react to inputs into the system at a synchronous timeframe.

For this project, I had used:<br/>
  2X NodeMCU V3 ESP8266 Wifi Modules<br/>
  2X 8 channel relays<br/>
  3X patterned outdoors lights<br/>
  1X stringed LED lights<br/>
  as well as Various electronic switches, LEDs, and current limiting resistors

Temporary setup with relay attached to the output ESP8266
- The indoors controller is on the larger breadboard
- The outdoors controller is on the smaller breadboard attached to the relay module
